    "In the above examples, we had to manually implement both the forward and backward passes of our neural network. Manually implementing the backward pass is not a big deal for a small two-layer network, but can quickly get very hairy for large complex networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thankfully, we can use [automatic differentiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_differentiation) to automate the computation of backward passes in neural networks. The `autograd` package in PyTorch provides exactly this functionality. When using `autograd`, the forward pass of your network will define a ***computational graph***; nodes in the graph will be *Tensors*, and edges will be *functions* that produce output Tensors from input Tensors. Backpropagating through this graph then allows you to easily compute gradients.\n",
    "\n",
    "This sounds complicated, itâ€™s pretty simple to use in practice. We wrap our PyTorch Tensors in `Variable` objects; a `Variable` represents a node in a *computational graph*. If `x` is a `Variable` then `x.data` is a Tensor, and `x.grad` is another Variable holding the gradient of `x` with respect to some scalar value.\n",
    "\n",
    "PyTorch Variables have the same API as PyTorch Tensors: (almost) any operation that you can perform on a Tensor also works on Variables; the difference is that using Variables defines a computational graph, allowing you to automatically compute gradients.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we use PyTorch Variables and `autograd` to implement our two-layer network; now we no longer need to manually implement the backward pass through the network:"

    "### TensorFlow: Static Graphs\n",

    "PyTorch autograd looks a lot like TensorFlow: in both frameworks we define a computational graph, and use automatic differentiation to compute gradients. The biggest difference between the two is that TensorFlowâ€™s computational graphs are **static** and PyTorch uses **dynamic computational graphs**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In TensorFlow, we define the computational graph once and then execute the same graph over and over again, possibly feeding different input data to the graph. In PyTorch, each forward pass defines a new computational graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "Static graphs are nice because you can optimize the graph up front; for example a framework might decide to fuse some graph operations for efficiency, or to come up with a strategy for distributing the graph across many GPUs or many machines. If you are reusing the same graph over and over, then this potentially costly up-front optimization can be amortized as the same graph is rerun over and over.\n",
    "\n",
    "One aspect where static and dynamic graphs differ is control flow. For some models we may wish to perform different computation for each data point; for example a recurrent network might be unrolled for different numbers of time steps for each data point; this unrolling can be implemented as a loop. With a static graph the loop construct needs to be a part of the graph; for this reason TensorFlow provides operators such as `tf.scan` for embedding loops into the graph. With dynamic graphs the situation is simpler: since we build graphs on-the-fly for each example, we can use normal **imperative flow control** to perform computation that differs for each input.\n",
