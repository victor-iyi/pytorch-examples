The `autograd` package in PyTorch provides exactly this functionality. When using `autograd`, the forward pass of your network will define a ***computational graph***; nodes in the graph will be *Tensors*, and edges will be *functions* that produce output Tensors from input Tensors. Backpropagating through this graph then allows you to easily compute gradients.\n",
