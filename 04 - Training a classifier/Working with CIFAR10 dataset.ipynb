    "This is it. You've seen how to define a simple convolutional neural network, compute loss w.r.t. the graph Variables, and make gradient updates manually and with `torch.nn.optim` package.\n",

    "Generally, when you have to deal with image, text, audio or video data, you can use standard python packages that load data into a numpy array. Then you can convert this array into a `torch.*Tensor`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For images, packages such as `Pillow`, `OpenCV` are useful.\n",
    "- For audio, packages such as `scipy` and `librosa`.\n",

    "\n",
    "Specifically for [Computer vision](), the creators of pytorch have generously created a package called `torchvision`, that has data loaders for common datasets such as Imagenet, CIFAR10, MNIST, etc. and data transformers for images, viz., `torchvision.datasets` and `torch.utils.data.DataLoader`. This provides a huge convinence from writing boiler plate code.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the **CIFAR10 dataset**. It has the classes: *‘airplane’, ‘automobile’, ‘bird’, ‘cat’, ‘deer’, ‘dog’, ‘frog’, ‘horse’, ‘ship’, ‘truck’*. The images in CIFAR-10 are of size `3x32x32`, i.e. 3-channel color images of `32x32` pixels in size.\n",
